        <p>
            Dear MDU Family,
            <br><br>
            At Misty's Dance Unlimited, the health and safety of our faculty and students are our most important priorities.
            <br><br>
            This afternoon Gov. Tony Evers has directed the state Department of Health Services to mandated all K-12 schools to shut down beginning Wednesday, March 18.
            <br><br>
            We have determined that is it in the best interest of our faculty and families to temporarily suspend all classes for that time period as well. Our last day of classes before the shut down will be the same as the schools - Tuesday, March 17.
            <br><br>
            To manage this change, we will be moving our previously schedule spring break up to the first week of the closure (meaning we will not have our ordinary spring break during Easter).
            <br><br>
            Also, we run a 32 week dance season, BUT we had scheduled for 33 weeks on the calendar this year! That means we already had one extra week of classes built into our schedule, for which we are VERY grateful.
            <br><br>
            <strong>We are planning to resume classes along with the local schools on Monday, April 6 and will offer a week of make up classes immediately following recital to cover the other service days.</strong> If anything changes with that timeline we will let you know.
            <br><br>
            <strong>In the meantime, we have been in contact with recital costume suppliers and Viterbo University and recital dates remain unchanged.</strong> We will continue to monitor the situation, and should other changes to our season be needed we will update you accordingly.
            <br><br>
            <strong>As always, but especially now, we greatly appreciate your support during these challenging times and so do all of the kids and teachers.</strong>
            <br><br>
            In partnership,
            <br><br>
            Misty Lown
