            Dear MDU Family,
            <br><br>
            As you know, we voluntarily closed our business last Wednesday when the La Crosse County Coulee COVID-19 Compass turned to RED. It was our hope that our community would band together to stay home and help curb the growing numbers of positive test results.
            <br><br>
            As of yesterday afternoon, the Coulee Covid-19 Compass remains in RED for our county. <strong>To help our community stay healthy and safe, MDU classes for the week of June 22-27 will be held ONLINE.</strong>  All private lessons and skills tests will be rescheduled. Please look for an individual email if that pertains to you <3.
            <br><br>
            We have been asked we will open back up if Coulee COVID-19 Compass goes to ORANGE later this week. The answer is that we will not. We feel strongly that our families and teachers need to be able to make plans for the week and that would not be good to wake up each day wondering and waiting for an announcement of what life will look like for the day. To that end, <strong>we will be making our decisions on the status of summer classes on a week-by-week basis.</strong>  A decision about the status of each weekâ€™s classes will be announced Sunday nights at 6pm.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Please check your email for online zoom links to your classes this week.</strong>
            <br><br>
            Thank you for your support as we seek to do our part to continue to serve our students while being good stewards of community health and our continued support efforts for our students and staff.
            <br><br>
            We appreciate our MDU families more than words can express and we can't wait to see you again in person some day.
            <br><br>
            In partnership,
            <br><br>
            Misty Lown
