            Dear MDU Family,
            <br><br>
            With Governor Ever's announcement today that schools will not reconvene for the remainder of the year, we wanted to let you know that we are diligently working on and praying about what this means for our programs. We are also still waiting for the CDC's new guidance about social distancing, which is expected in early May.
            <br><br>
            So while we do not yet have answers as to what is possible as we seek to reimagine things like our recital, competition and ballet show, here's what we DO know:
            <br><br>
            Our TEACHERS are going to continue to SHOW UP and SHOW OUT for your kids in our weekly classes and activities (which go until May 16)!
            <br><br>
            We are still going to HONOR our SENIORS in a special way!
            <br><br>
            We are going to continue to make PRUDENT decisions that prioritize the SAFETY and HEALTH of our teachers, students, and community-at-large.
            <br><br>
            We will continue to adapt and we will GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.
            <br><br>
            Because of your support, our studio will BE HERE FOR THE KIDS today...and we will be here when the day comes that we can see each other again in person.
            <br><br>
            We will hold a second MDU Family Chat with our updated plan in early May after the CDC releases its next round of recommendations for social distancing. In the meantime, we THANK YOU for your ongoing support for our teachers and our students as we seek to continue to be an anchor of familiarity and community at this time.
            <br><br>
            In closing, I once read this quote when my best friend was undergoing treatment for cancer. I think there is so much in this that applies to our current pandemic.
            <br><br>
            And, so we continue FORWARD in love, hope, faith, and friendship; showing courage for our kids, creating new memories and lifting the spirit of our community along the way.
            <br><br>
            With appreciation, Miss Misty
