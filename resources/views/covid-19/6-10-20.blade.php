        <p>
            Dear MDU Family,
            <br><br>
            Two weeks ago we took our first steps towards re-opening our facility by serving ONE family at a time at our Red Carpet Recitals!
            <br><br>
            Next week we take forward by serving TWO rooms at a time (which is less than we had on opening day 23 years ago:).
            <br>I know so many of our students are busting at the seems to get back (and parents might be more than ready to get their kids out of the house!) but we are sticking with our staggered and structured re-opening, one baby step at a time.
            <br><br>
            And, by baby steps, I mean BABY steps.  We are still 50% online for June and of the programs we are offering on-site, we are only opening 28% of our classrooms.
            <br>Please see our <a href="/">June Newsletter</a> for additional information regarding our first steps back into the classroom and thank you for your patience as we build our program back one step at a time &#9829;.
            <br>Please check the MDU website before your class for the stop-and-go light indicator in the upper right-hand corner which indicates the status of classes.
            <br>Sincerely,
            <br>Misty Lown
        </p>
