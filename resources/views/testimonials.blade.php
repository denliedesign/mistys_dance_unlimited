                            I have been so impressed with Misty’s Dance Unlimited as they have navigated through this unprecedented time with COVID. The communication and professionalism has been so amazing!! My daughter has danced for many years, but this is her first year with MDU  and she has loved every minute. They teach dance, but stress the importance of being a kind, hard working individual...they care about each student  as a person, not just a dancer. My daughter has gained so much confidence and has found a real love for the art of dance.

                            Some companies create catchy tag lines because they sound good, rhyme well, or are memorable.  MDU's - more than just great dance tag line speaks to the core of who they are.  This studio's focus is on building character, creating confidence, and improving the mental & physical strength in the lives that they touch.  I'm so thankful we found this studio and that my children are gaining life skills that will propel them into a successful adulthood.

                            Misty's Dance has been an amazing place for my daughter to not only make friends but to find confidence in herself. They value all who walk through there doors and always greet you with a smile. I couldn't ask for a better place for my little girl to grow and learn through dance. Misty's Dance is definitely More Than Just Great Dancing! ❤

                            When I switched my girls over to Misty's Dance three years ago it meant driving an 1 hr one way for each day they danced. At the time that was two days a week. Last year two on my boys also asked to begin dancing and they loved it as well. The girls cannot see themselves not participating in dance each year. Even when the classrooms were closed the speed with which the studio was able to adapt and offer Virtual Classes was amazing! Thank you Misty I have 2 girls who have no interest in dancing anywhere else!

                            My daughter and I LOVE Misty's Dance and all the personnel and instructors there.  We have always felt more than welcome walking in the door.  Everyone has a smile on their face.   They are professional, organized and great role models for our youth.  Plus they are doing all they can to keep a safe & clean environment amidst COVID-19!!

                            My 5 year old daughter has been dancing now at  Misty’s for her second year and has been the best experience. She craves time with kids her age and to be active. Covid has not stopped her from being able to do this and do this safely. I would 100% recommend this dance studio over and over!

                            We couldn't be more pleased with the quality of instruction at Misty's Dance Unlimited. Our girls have grown so much in their dance knowledge and skill. They look so forward to class and learning from quality instructors who have wonderful, caring personalities. Misty is a role model to all the students and staff with her dancing talent, public speaking, and delightful personality. We are so thankful to have this classy studio in the area.                        </p>

                            This was our first year at Misty's and ALL the staff were amazing and welcoming!  Kris was always prompt with getting back to me and all my questions.  Everyone sitting at the front desk was always helpful and greeting you with a smile.  The teachers took the time to get to know my girls and make them feel welcome and alleviated their fears of joining a new studio.  Couldn't have asked for a better year!  Thank you!!

                            My daughter joined an amazing group of teachers, friends and mentors at Misty's 2 years ago!  She looks forward to dance each night and had become a stronger more confident dancer.  She is on their Performance Company and loves the relationships she has built with other kids her age, with the same passion and vision she has for dance.  She has a 2nd family at the Studio; without Misty's Dance Unlimited, I don't think she would have found something she is so passionate about!
