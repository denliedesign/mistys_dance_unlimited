    <h4>REVEL TUTORIAL TUESDAY</h4>
    <p>
        We realize that most studios are closed or partially operating during the outbreak of COVID-19 in the US.  Many are using online and virtual tools to keep kids dancing during this difficult time.  We'd like to help with this effort, and it's FREE.  Each weekend during our regional tour, REVEL films a short tutorial of a combination taught by one of our Faculty during the event. Tutorials are 10 minutes or less, span all styles of dance, and give dancers who were not able to attend the event an opportunity to learn them remotely.  We then post these on our Instagram IGTV as a "Tutorial Tuesday".  A FREE library of these Tutorial Tuesday videos is available on REVEL's Instagram IGTV.  All you need to do is visit our Instagram page @reveldanceconvention, and click the IGTV icon to access our videos.  You can also share/email links to each tutorial you choose to use with your dancers by clicking the 3 dots and "copy link". We encourage studios to share these free videos with their students in an effort to support their available online resources and tools.  To make it even more fun for your kiddos, have your dancers post themselves doing the combos, and be sure to tag us and our Faculty.  We will share some of our favorites on our Story!  If you have any questions on how to access and share these with your dancers, don't hesitate to reply to this email.  We will all get through this as a community.
